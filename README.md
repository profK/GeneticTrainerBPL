This is a UE5 Blue Print Function library plugin that implements a genetic trainer for a genome of arbitrary size where each gene is represented by a floating poitn number.
It uses a "wheel of fortune" weighted random based on scores provided to it to select parnet genomes to breed. Crossovber is arthimatic. (There is a conditional
compilation flag to do logical crossover instead.)
